The Objective of Blackjack......Beat The Dealer. 

*How do you beat the dealer?

  By drawing a hand value that is higher than the dealer’s hand value.
  By the dealer drawing a hand value that goes over 21.
  By drawing a hand value of 21 on your first two cards, when the dealer does not.

*How do you lose to the dealer? 

  Your hand value exceeds 21.
  The dealers hand has a greater value than yours at the end of the round.

  If you draw the same value as the dealer, it is a tie.

*How Do You Find a Hand’s Total Value?

  Blackjack is played with a conventional deck of 52 playing cards and suits don’t matter.

  2 through 10 count at face value, i.e. a 2 counts as two, a 9 counts as nine.
  Face cards (J,Q,K) count as 10.
  Ace can count as a 1 or an 11 depending on which value helps the hand the most.
