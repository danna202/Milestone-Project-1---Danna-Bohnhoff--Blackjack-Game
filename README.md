Blackjack:
The object of the game is to beat the dealer.

How do you beat the dealer?

By drawing a hand value that is higher than the dealerâ€™s hand value
By the dealer drawing a hand value that goes over 21.
By drawing a hand value of 21 on your first two cards, when the dealer does not.

How do you lose to the dealer? 

Your hand value exceeds 21.
The dealers hand has a greater value than yours at the end of the round.

If you draw the same value as the dealer, it is a tie.
