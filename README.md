The object of the game Blackjack,is to get as close to 21
as possible without going over.

*How do you beat the dealer?
   Get a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it, while also having a higher hand value than the dealer.

*Hand Total: The value of your hand is determined by adding up the point values of each card. Numbered cards (2 to 10) are worth their face value, face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10, and Aces can be worth 1 or 11, whichever is more advantageous for your hand.

*Player's Turn: You, as the player, get to make decisions about your hand. You have the following options:

Click "Hit" to receive an additional card from the dealer. Try to get your hand value closer to 21 without exceeding it.
Click "Stand" if you are satisfied with your hand value and want to end your turn.

*Dealer's Turn: After you have finished your turn, it's the dealer's turn. The computer dealer will automatically follow a strict rule: they must hit until they have a hand value of 17 or more.

*Winning and Losing: At the end of the round, the winner is determined based on the following conditions:

If your hand value is higher than the dealer's hand value without exceeding 21, you beat the dealer.
If the dealer's hand value exceeds 21 (bust), you win regardless of your hand value.
If your hand value exceeds 21, you lose (bust).
If the dealer's hand value is higher than yours without exceeding 21, you lose.
If you and the dealer have the same hand value, it is a tie (push).
Blackjack: If your first two cards are an Ace and a 10-value card (10, Jack, Queen, or King), you have a "Blackjack." A Blackjack automatically wins, except against the dealer's Blackjack, which results in a tie.

*Next Round: After the outcome is determined, a new round begins. You can place your bet again and continue playing.
